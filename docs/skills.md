description: Drop-in skills that teach your AI coding agent the effect-uai primitives, provider wiring, and recipe patterns.
---

`effect-uai` ships a bundle of [agent skills](https://agentskills.io)
for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, …). One main
skill covers the philosophy, primitives, and provider wiring; focused
sub-skills carry each recipe or capability pattern. The agent only
loads a skill when its description matches your prompt.

## Install

Via the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) CLI:

```sh
npx skills add betalyra/effect-uai
```

Cherry-pick a single skill instead:

```sh
npx skills add betalyra/effect-uai/tree/main/skills/effect-uai-model-retry
```

## What loads when

The main skill (`effect-uai`) loads on broad signals like _"I'm
building an AI agent in Effect"_. Recipe sub-skills load on specific
scenarios:
