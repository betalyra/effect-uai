## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Tool approval moves out of the executor. `Toolkit.executeAll(tools, calls)`
  now only runs the calls you pass it; `Resolver`, `executeAllWithResolver`,
  `withPermissions`, and `withFallback` are removed. Recipes call the new
  planners (below) before `executeAll` and merge any rejected results into
  the event stream themselves. The pre-execution `ToolDecision` /
  `execute` / `reject` constructors in `Outcome` are gone with it.
- `Resolvers` reshaped around two planners that return data, not effects:
  - `fromApprovalMap(predicate, approvals)(calls)` returns a `ToolCallPlan`
    (`{ approved, rejected }`) synchronously.
  - `fromVerdictQueue(predicate, queue)(calls)` returns
    `{ approved, decisions, announce }` — `approved` runs immediately,
    `decisions` streams `ToolCallDecision`s as verdicts arrive, `announce`
    surfaces `ApprovalRequested` events for the UI.
  - New helpers: `ToolCallPlan`, `ToolCallDecision`, `approve`, `reject`,
    `splitToolCallDecisions`, `approvalRequested`.
- New `Toolkit.outputEvent(result)` / `Toolkit.outputEvents(results)` for
  turning rejected tool results back into `ToolEvent.Output`s when merging
  with `Toolkit.executeAll`.
- `Turn.appendTurn(state, turn, items?)` replaces the `Cursor<S>` / `cursor`
  pair. State advancement is now a single helper that appends `turn.items`
  plus any follow-up items (typically tool outputs) to `state.history` —
  no intermediate stamped wrapper.
