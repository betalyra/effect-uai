description: Talk to your agent. Streaming STT to LLM to streaming TTS, with stop-word interrupt and follow-up queueing.
---

A voice assistant is three streams talking to each other.

Speech-to-text turns the user's mic into committed utterances. The LLM
answers each utterance. Streaming text-to-speech reads the answer aloud
as soon as the first deltas arrive.

**Scenario.** Open a tab, click **Start**, allow mic access, ask a
question. Ask a follow-up while the assistant is still speaking and it
queues. Say "stop" mid-answer and playback is cancelled so you can ask
the next thing.

## The Pipeline

The recipe composes three provider surfaces without a voice-assistant
framework:

- `Transcriber.streamTranscriptionFrom` listens to the mic and emits
  partial and final transcript events.
- `LanguageModel.streamTurn` answers each final utterance.
- `SpeechSynthesizer.streamSynthesisFrom` turns the LLM's text deltas
  into audio chunks.

The pipeline is still ordinary Effect code. Provider selection lives in
`run-bun.ts`; the recipe body works against the service tags and
capability markers.

## Turn Handling

Each committed user utterance becomes one assistant turn. The outer
stream runs turns sequentially, so a follow-up spoken while the
assistant is answering waits its turn instead of racing the current
answer.

Realtime STT can split one human sentence into multiple finals around a
short pause. The local `settleBurst` helper waits briefly before
starting the LLM, so "what about Paris ... in winter?" is treated as
one user turn.

## Interruption model

The assistant has two behaviors:

- **Follow-up questions queue.** A normal utterance spoken while the
  assistant is still answering runs after the current turn completes.
  Nothing is lost.
- **Stop words interrupt explicitly.** A final containing a stop
  word cuts the active turn via `Fiber.interrupt`. The interrupt
  handler commits whatever was spoken so far, and the browser flushes
  playback on `assistant-cancelled`.

The recipe intentionally interrupts on final transcripts, not partials.
Partials are speculative; a half-heard "okay" should not cancel the
assistant. A final like `"Stop. Tell me about chemistry"` both cancels
the current audio and queues the chemistry question as the next turn.

## Run it

```sh
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=... GOOGLE_API_KEY=... bun recipes/voice-loop/run-bun.ts
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>, click **Start**, allow mic access,
speak.

> Run with **`bun`** — the runner uses `Bun.serve` and `Bun.build`.

Env vars:

- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` — used for both STT (Scribe v2 Realtime) and
  TTS (Flash v2.5).
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` — used for Gemini 2.5 Flash.
- `PORT` — optional, defaults to `3000`.

## Architecture

```
[Browser]  getUserMedia → AudioWorklet → WebSocket
   ↕
[Bun server]  Effect pipeline (one per WS connection):
   shared STT events (Stream.share)
     ├─► stop-word watcher    ─► Fiber.interrupt(activeTurn) on "stop" / …
     └─► utterance loop:
            settleBurst("350 millis")     ─► coalesce close-together finals
            forkChild(runAssistantTurn)   ─► one fiber per turn, awaited
              LanguageModel.streamTurn(...) → Turn.textDeltas
              → SpeechSynthesizer.streamSynthesisFrom (ElevenLabs WS)
              → PCM s16le 48 kHz chunks sent + paced
[Browser]  ring-buffered AudioWorklet → speakers (cleared on cancel)
```

One WebSocket carries the demo traffic:

- **Browser → server**: binary frames only. Each is ~50 ms of PCM
  s16le @ 16 kHz mono mic audio from `mic-worklet.js`.
- **Server → browser**:
  - **Binary frames** — PCM s16le @ 48 kHz mono TTS audio.
  - **Text frames (JSON)** — `StatusEvent`: `user-partial` /
    `user-final` / `assistant-thinking` / `assistant-delta` /
    `assistant-done` / `assistant-cancelled` / `error`. The browser
    updates the chat UI from these; `assistant-cancelled` also tells
    the playback worklet to flush its ring buffer for instant
    silence.

The browser fetches `/config` at start to learn the mic + playback
sample rates.

## What This Generalizes To

The recipe is a worked example of three primitives composed with
ordinary Effect concurrency. The same shape applies whenever you
have:

- A long-lived input stream that occasionally emits a *commit*
  (transcription finals; chat messages; sensor thresholds);
- Work per commit that should run one-at-a-time;
- An interrupt signal that needs to cut the active work cleanly.

Swap STT for a Kafka topic, the LLM for any per-message Effect, and
TTS for a downstream service — the fiber-per-turn + `Stream.share` +
stop-word watcher structure carries over without changes.
